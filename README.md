# Twitch-User-Analysis

The Data used in this project was extracted via the Twitch API. This project was done for credit during the first semester of the Data Science Masters Program as UNCW.

I used the extraction notebook to pull the data I wished to analyze and then imported the data into my analysis workbook to compare each channels performance.

This was done over the span of 4 weeks during the semester.

There are 3 missing files for the analysis (ninjafollowers, ninjafollower2, and sykkuno followers) that were unable to be uploaded due to extreme file sizes. These can be pulled using the data extraction notebook for yourself.

There is a shortened 30 minute presentation discussing our findings and analysis that can be viewed via YouTube. Link: https://youtu.be/Y6vBDd312U8
